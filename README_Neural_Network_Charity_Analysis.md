# NEURAL NETWORK CHARITY ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW

### The purpose of this analysis is to help the charitable foundation, Alphabet Soup, predict where to make investments.

### Using machine learning and neural networks we will use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting weather charity applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### The dataset is a csv file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.

### There will 4 deliverables in this analysis:

### 1) Preprocessing Data for a neural network model

### 2) Compile, train and evaluate the model.

### 3) Optimize the model.

### 4) Provide a written report on the Neural Network Model.

## RESOURCES

### File: charity_data.csv

### sklearn.model_selection. (import train_test_split)
